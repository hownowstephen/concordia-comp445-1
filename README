The application is a basic FTP client/server application over tcp and winsock.
Client and server both are able to perform a get and put, and the server is
configured to use the windows threading interface to provide multiple simultaneous
inbound connections.

Included are the following files:

cli_tcp.cpp - The FTP client
ser_tcp.cpp - The FTP server
filetransfer.cpp - The custom file transfer protocol library, providing an interface 
                   for get and put operations.
Makefile - The makefile, optimized for MinGW/GNU

The application was made to be built using MinGW on windows, and was built and
developed under Cygwin. It should work as well with Visual Studio, but is best
compiled using the GCC c++ compiler (g++) and GNU Make

Basic build: make clean && make all
Server application: ./server.exe
Client application: ./client.exe

The server assumes a one-dimensional filesystem, and does not allow for spaces in
filenames, as the basic protocol used to negotiate file transfer reserves spaces
as special characters. Files are stored and retrieved from the working directory
the server is being run from (so generally best not to run it in a sensitive directory)

All code was adapted from sample code provided for the purposes of Concordia COMP 445 W12
